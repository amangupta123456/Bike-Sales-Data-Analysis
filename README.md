Sample Insights:
-
1. Men tend to have the highest average income per purchase in bikes.
2. Middle-aged customers (31-54) make the most purchases.
3. Customers who commute 0-1 miles have the highest count of bike purchases.
4. Single graduate men who buy bikes have the highest income per purchase.
5. North American customers make the most bike purchases.
6. Customers in management and professional occupations have the highest income per purchase, but they tend to commute more than 10 miles.

Suggestion:
-
Our main customer base consists of men living in North America, employed in management and professional occupations, and commuting less than 10 miles. To increase sales, we should provide good offers and show ads targeting these customers.

(Based on the sample insights, we can infer that customers with commutes of 0-1 miles are most likely to purchase bikes, while those in management and professional occupations who commute more than 10 miles are also likely to buy bikes. Therefore, we should focus on customers with commutes of less than 10 miles.)
